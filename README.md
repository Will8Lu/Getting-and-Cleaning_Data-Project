Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 
A CodeBook, R script and A tidy data set ("Tidy_data.txt") in text format have been included in the Repo.

The CodeBook contains list of variables names in the tidy dataset and summary of the data set.
The R script does following:

1. Download the zip file in local disk, then load all required files into R after unzip the file.
2. Merge the Training and the Test data into one data set
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4. Uses decriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
6. Create a tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and subject
